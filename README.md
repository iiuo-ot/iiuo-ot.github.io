## 📦 Repository Structure  
This root repository serves as the **landing site** and central index for the project.  
Each individual tool is maintained in its **own repository** for easier maintenance, versioning and isolation.

Example structure:

```
iiuo‑ot.github.io/           ← this repo (root site)  
word‑counter/                ← tool repo: iiuo‑ot/word‑counter  
text‑case‑converter/         ← tool repo: iiuo‑ot/text-case-converter  
remove‑extra‑spaces/         ← tool repo: iiuo‑ot/remove-extra-spaces  
blogger‑robots‑generator/    ← tool repo: iiuo‑ot/blogger-robots-generator  
…                            ← and so on  
```

Each tool repository includes its own README, source files, demo and deployment.

## 🚀 About the Project  
**Online Tools** is created by [It Is Unique Official](https://itisuniqueofficial.com) (via the GitHub organisation `iiuo‑ot`).  
It’s designed to provide simple, powerful web‑utilities — built with minimal dependencies, and focused on usability:

- Built with HTML5, CSS3 (including dark theme + responsive design)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) — no heavy frameworks  
- 100% browser‑based; works on desktop & mobile  
- Privacy‑first: no ads, no trackers, no cookies (beyond what your browser uses)  
- Hosted via GitHub Pages for each tool and for the site  

Whether you’re writing, coding, optimizing or formatting — you’ll find a utility here.
